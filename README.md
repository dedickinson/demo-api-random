# Demo API - Random

A super basic [Flask-based API](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
that just produces out a random number.

Run up minikube and then get started with:

    make

And blow it all away with:

    make cleanall

## Dev notes for Windows

To install `make` on Windows:

    choco install make
